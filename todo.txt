todo:
- finish todo list :D
- look into hitbox detection - now accomplished with get_overlapping_areas(), there is area_entered signal that should but does not work, problaly because translations instead of physics is beeing used
- clean up signals
- modify powerups - they are now just removed with queue_free(), instead their hitbox should be disabled and some kind of animation or smth played
+- add sound
- add clicky menu
- add scoreboard
- modify visuals - change objects with their corresponding hitboxes, particle effects etc

possibly:
- add more types of powerups
